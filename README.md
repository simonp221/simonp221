PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY
▪B.A. Computer Science program (York University, Ontario)
▪Interested in data science and machine learning, with a focus on applying advanced techniques to solve real-world problems such as signal processing, image analysis, and natural language processing (NLP).
▪I enjoy working with large datasets and relational structures, exploring insights through databases and efficient data management. 
▪Familiar Python-based frameworks such as numpy, scipy, pandas, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch for modeling and computation, as well as NLP-specific tools like Stanford CoreNLP and stanza.
My goal is to leverage these skills to develop robust, scalable, and interpretable models that bridge the gap between theory and industry applications.
▪ Completed Mathematics coursework in Calculus, Discrete Mathematics, Logic, Linear Algebra, Statistics and Probability.
▪ Hands-on programming experience in Java, Python, C, SQL, Prolog, R, and LINUX/UNIX environments.
▪ B.A. in English Literature with a second specialization in Hispanic Studies.
▪ Previous work experience in both Spanish and French speaking environments.
